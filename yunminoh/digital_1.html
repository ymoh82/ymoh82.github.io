                    <br>“A global approach to data-driven innovation”
                    </h3>
                    <p>This dashboard addresses the needs of three different personas including executive, marketer, and designer in Adidas’ fashion sneaker department. It is controlled by a physical control “globe,” which will allow the user to select different region to get the data-driven inspiration from all over the world. We envisioned this dashboard to be placed in the break room of the Portland office to facilitate conversation between designers and marketers. </p>

                <h3>Data Analysis & Affinity Diagramming</h3>
                <div class="affinitydiagram">
                  <div class="col-4 box diagram1"></div>
                  <div class="col-4 box diagram2"></div>
                  <div class="col-4 box diagram3"></div>
                </div>
                <p>We wrote down some customer reviews on the sticky notes and organized them into groupings based on their relationships. We identified that customer reviews can be largely classified into 1) feedback on the physical shoes including positive, negative comments, and supplier issues and 2) emotional components including intentions and value for money.
                <br>
                Based on the affinity diagram, we created this pre-dashboard (current state model). We realized that currently, their design and production process is quite sequential and linear and depends on direct reviews received from customers. We wanted to make this process more iterative by allowing multiple sources of data for possible improvements that is constantly updated. 
                <br>
                In addition, we found how there was a lack of consideration of societal influences including changing trends, changing customer behavior and intentions in their business decisions. Therefore, we tried to incorporate more societal influences in our future state model.</p>

                    <div class="box sketch1"></div>

                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>After evaluating the three personas and understanding their experiences and goals, we started sketching elements of the dashboard that would help enhance their experiences and achieve their goals. We combined all individual components to put them into one dashboard. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="content">
                <h3>Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
                <div class="midfidimg">
                  <div class="col-6 child">
                    <div class="box mid1"></div>
                  </div>

                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Though our dashboard had interesting data, we were presenting information that they might already have. We wanted to influence them, not necessarily inform them since they already have the data. We just needed to present that data in a way that would lead to data-driven design and marketing decisions.<br>
                Hence, we changed our widgets to show both statistics and images of the current trends in the fashion sneaker world to influence designers and marketers to work towards making that trend an opportunity for boosting sales. We made our motion about updating the data as a reflection of the outside world, things changed on our dashboard when the selected region changes.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="content">
                <h3>Motion</h3>
                <div class="motionimg">
                  <div class="col-6 child">
                    <div class="box motion"></div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>Lastly, we designed the globe to be in spinning motion by default and can allow users to select a region manually by selecting a destination on the globe. However, a feedback we received was the fact that having an individual block a large portion of the dashboard in efforts to change the destination would be inconvenient, especially if there are others who are also trying to view this dashboard. 
                <br>
                After taking that point into consideration, we chose to remove the globe from the dashboard itself and have it as the physical control, which can allow users to change the display, but not affect others in the process of doing so. </p>

              <div class="content">
                <h3>Physical Control</h3>

                </div>
                <p>We created this physical globe that allows users to spin it and select one of the highlighted pink dots, which represent different fashion hubs that Adidas has an office in. Once the new location is selected, their yellow location pin will be moved to the selected area, and all the widgets on the dashboard will be updated. </p>

              <div class="finaltext">
              <p>Our final design has a strong global element to it — our control changes between locations and our widgets change accordingly. This allows the users to look through what is happening in the fashion sneaker world globally. There are 5 widgets — social media, designer favorites, current trends, influential campaigns and potential ambassadors. The current trends are a display of statistical information on how popular the top trends are based on how often they are mentioned in media. The social media widget shows Instagram and TikTok posts according to the top trends, and changes when there is a change in the ranking of the current trends. Designer favorites is a chosen designer’s digital bulletin board at display, which changes on a weekly basis, and also pulls more relevant posts from their board when the location changes. The influential campaigns have information about past and current collaborations with celebrities and influencers, and potential ambassadors show celebrities and influencers that would be good for future collaborations. </p>
